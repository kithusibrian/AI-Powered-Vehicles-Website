```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Testing

Currently, no automated tests are included. Manual testing is recommended for key user flows such as browsing cars, searching, and authentication.

## Deployment

This Next.js application is optimized for deployment on Vercel. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repository using the Vercel platform.
The Project also uses docker for containerization thou it isnt supported by vercel.Hence not included in The Github commit
